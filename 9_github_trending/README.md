# How to use

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3

$ python github_trending.py # alternatively try python3
